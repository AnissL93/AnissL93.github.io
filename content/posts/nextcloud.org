This blog records my experience of deploying Nextcloud and Talk. The basic idea is to first deploy the Nextcloud service on my local PC, and use frp, vps, ningx and a public domain to allow public accessing.

* Prepare
- vps (I use linode). Assume the ip addr is <vps-ip>.
- domain (I use namecheap). Assume the domain is yourdomain.com.
- a local PC (I use an old thinkpad)
* Set up domain
Open manage DNS, and add A record

* Set up vps
* Set up
