I recently developed a hid proxy for connecting ble keyboards so that I can use my bluetooth keyboards at work, where computers have no bluetooth adapter and a pluggable adapter is also not allowed.

A decent hid proxy should support following functions:
1. Stably connecting to ble keyboards.
2. Be able to tell current status of the proxy, for example, if it's already connected to a device or it is searching one.

Following is the final outcome.
